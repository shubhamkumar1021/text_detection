# text_detection

Detecting plagiarism in text involves comparing one text (the "source" or "suspected" text) with one or more other texts (the "reference" or "original" texts) to determine if there are similarities that may indicate plagiarism. There are various methods and techniques for detecting plagiarism, including:

Text Comparison: Directly comparing the source text to one or more reference texts to identify matching or highly similar sections.

Text Similarity Metrics: Calculating similarity scores between the source and reference texts using techniques such as cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, or Euclidean distance.

N-gram Analysis: Breaking texts into smaller units (n-grams) and comparing them to identify shared sequences of wrds.

Machine Learning: Training machine learning models (e.g., neural networks or decision trees) on labeled data to classify texts as plagiarized or non-plagiarized.

Citation Analysis: Analyzing citations and references to check for proper attribution.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Using NLP techniques to analyze the linguistic and syntactic patterns of texts to detect similarities.
